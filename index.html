      <p>That basket looks good, doesn't it? Don't you wish you could reach in and grab a grape?
        How about making a salad. It would be so tempting to sit down right now with it!</p>
        
     <p> But isn't there something missing here? Are there more foods that should be in this cornucopia? Is your vision of vgetables lacking those dark, leafy greens? What are they anyway?
     </p>
     
     <p> Perhaps you've heard of a whole foods plant based diet but didn't quite understand what it implied. Vegan? Not exactly.</p>
     
     <p> While a vegan diet eliminates dairy, meats, poultry, eggs and fish, there's plenty of room for junk food, or food that has been 'particled'</p>
     
     <h3> Junk Food ?</h3>
     
     <p> Junk food can be roughly defined to include any edible that provides empty calories, or calories that do not have a nutritional value.</p>
     
     <p> For instance, a candy bar, while tasting delicious, will provide fat and sugar calories, but little nutritional value. </p>
     
     <!--next paragraph needs work-->
     <p> Let's take a pretzel, for instance. It could be considered as a particled food. Its components are flour, salt and water, for the most part. Doesn't sound too harmful. But what are we eating? If it isn't wholewheat flour, we are missing fiber, and any other nutrient that comes with wholewheat, a whole food. </p>
     
     <p> French fries, just potatoes fried in oil, are vegan, but are they a whole food? Unless they are cooked in their skin, they are missing valuable vitamins. Frying in oil loads the potato with fat calories - not a desirable trait! So, while vegan, the fries are not an optimal wholefood.</p> 
     
     <h3>The Missing Powerhouses: Dark leafy greens</h3> 
     
     <p> The purpose of this site is to introduce the green edibles, nutritional work horses for our bodies. Starting off with the relatively familiar, we will gradually build a great site loaded with luscious, tasty greens!</p>
